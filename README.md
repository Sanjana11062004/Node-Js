Concepts included are:

1. File System Operations: Involves reading, modifying, and writing files using Node.js built-in modules like fs. This includes tasks such as reading a text file, making changes to its content, and writing the modified content to a new file.

2. Express.js Basics: Creating a simple Express.js application with routes for handling HTTP requests such as GET and POST. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.

3. Middleware Implementation: Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request and response objects. It can modify these objects, execute additional code, or terminate the request-response cycle. Implementing custom middleware involves logging request details, modifying request/response objects, or handling errors.

4. RESTful API Development: Developing a RESTful API involves defining routes for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources such as users or products. These operations correspond to HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

5. Authentication with JWT: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a popular method for implementing authentication in web applications. It involves generating and verifying tokens that are sent with each request to authenticate users. Implementing JWT authentication in Express.js involves generating tokens upon login, verifying tokens on protected routes, and handling user sessions.

6. Database Integration: Integrating a database with an Express.js application allows you to perform CRUD operations on data. In this I have used MySQL database and created a employee database with an employeeDetails table where we would perform the crud.

7. Error Handling and Logging: Error handling middleware in Express.js catches errors that occur during request processing and allows you to handle them gracefully. Logging error details to a file or console helps in troubleshooting and debugging applications.

8. Asynchronous Control Flow: In Node.js applications, asynchronous control flow is essential for performing multiple operations in parallel or sequentially without blocking the event loop. This can be achieved using async/await or promises to handle asynchronous operations and errors appropriately.

9. Scheduled Tasks with Node.js Cron: Node.js Cron allows you to schedule recurring tasks. This involves defining cron jobs that execute functions according to a predefined schedule.

10. Payload Validation Middleware: Validating request payloads ensures that incoming data meets certain criteria or follows a specific schema. Middleware for payload validation can use libraries like Joi or express-validator to define validation schemas and handle validation errors. This helps maintain data integrity and security in Express.js applications.

I have used powershell commands to execute nodejs scripts.
